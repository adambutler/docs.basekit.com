# Editing a theme

This document will explain how to use our Theme Viewer and how to upload that final theme. If you haven’t downloaded your theme for editing yet please check out the [How to download a theme](/getting-started/downloading/) documentation.

Welcome to the Theme Viewer where you can view your theme on your local machine.

## Your code editor 

Use your [code editor](/getting-started/#a-code-editor) of choice to open your chosen theme. In our example below we are using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor:

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/sublime.png" alt="Sublime Text" %}

You will see your folder options - Feel free to rename these or take a look inside.

## Viewing your changes

Once you have made your code changes you might want to 'update' with the Theme Viewer to view those changes and make sure everything works. You can do this as you go along if preferred. You can do this by clicking the update button at the top right hand corner of the Theme Viewer. This will then pull your masterpiece of code from your chosen code editor into the Theme Viewer.

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/theme-viewer-buttons.png" alt="Theme Viewer buttons" %}

If you are happy with your changes you can then save the file, convert the theme into a zip file, and upload it back to the Editor. Zip the file back up with your changes click on the 'Save as Zip' button. You will then need to find your zip file on your computer - This would normally be where your downloaded items end up. 

## Uploading to the Editor

Open up the Editor and click on the theme panel on the left hand side.

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/theme-tab.png" alt="theme tab" %}

Click on Upload theme as zip button.

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/download-theme-2.png" alt="upload theme" %}

You’ll automatically be directed to a page where you will need to choose your theme zip file:

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/import-theme.png" alt="import theme" %}

Once you have selected your file click on the **Upload** button.

Your theme and any changes made will have uploaded to the Editor for you to make further content changes if needed.
